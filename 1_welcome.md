<strong><a href = "/dashboards/thelook/business_pulse" style="text-decoration:underline">The Business Pulse Dashboard</a></strong> provides a highly manicured executive summary of the current status of the business. Interactive filtering and drilling within the dashbaord provide a curated, interactive experience for users with limited data skills to ask and answer questions based on patterns and trends in the data in real time.

Regardless of their level of SQL knowledge, analysts and business users alike have the power and depth of the entire database at their fingertips to easily answer ad-hoc questions and quickly build visualizations, dashbaords, and automated reports. Looker's 100% browser based workflow enables fast and easy collaboration and sharing.
